        I'm a full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript developer based in Bremen,
        Germany, with over 5 years of experience building reliable web
        applications. While I specialize in Angular and NX, Iâ€™ve also worked
        with frameworks like Astro and Next.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy creating efficient and user-friendly solutions, and I share my
        knowledge by writing articles online about web development.
